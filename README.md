This repo is for review of requests for signing shim.  To create a request for review:

- clone this repo
- edit the template below
- add the shim.efi to be signed
- add build logs
- add any additional binaries/certificates/SHA256 hashes that may be needed
- commit all of that
- tag it with a tag of the form "myorg-shim-arch-YYYYMMDD"
- push that to github
- file an issue at https://github.com/rhboot/shim-review/issues with a link to your tag
- approval is ready when the "accepted" label is added to your issue

Note that we really only have experience with using GRUB2 on Linux, so asking
us to endorse anything else for signing is going to require some convincing on
your part.

Here's the template:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### What organization or people are asking to have this signed?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[your text here]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### What product or service is this for?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[your text here]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### What's the justification that this really does need to be signed for the whole world to be able to boot it?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[your text here]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Who is the primary contact for security updates, etc.?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Name:
- Position:
- Email address:
- PGP key fingerprint:

(Key should be signed by the other security contacts, pushed to a keyserver
like keyserver.ubuntu.com, and preferably have signatures that are reasonably
well known in the Linux community.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Who is the secondary contact for security updates, etc.?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Name:
- Position:
- Email address:
- PGP key fingerprint:

(Key should be signed by the other security contacts, pushed to a keyserver
like keyserver.ubuntu.com, and preferably have signatures that are reasonably
well known in the Linux community.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Were these binaries created from the 15.6 shim release tar?
Please create your shim binaries starting with the 15.6 shim release tar file: https://github.com/rhboot/shim/releases/download/15.6/shim-15.6.tar.bz2

This matches https://github.com/rhboot/shim/releases/tag/15.6 and contains the appropriate gnu-efi source.

### If shim is loading GRUB2 bootloader what exact implementation of Secureboot in GRUB2 do you have? (Either Upstream GRUB2 shim_lock verifier or Downstream RHEL/Fedora/Debian/Canonical-like implementation)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[your text here]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### If shim is loading GRUB2 bootloader and your previously released shim booted a version of grub affected by any of the CVEs in the July 2020 grub2 CVE list, the March 2021 grub2 CVE list, or the June 7th 2022 grub2 CVE list:

### Were old shims hashes provided to Microsoft for verification and to be added to future DBX updates?
### Does your new chain of trust disallow booting old GRUB2 builds affected by the CVEs?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[your text here]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### If your boot chain of trust includes a Linux kernel:
### Is upstream commit [1957a85b0032a81e6482ca4aab883643b8dae06e "efi: Restrict efivar_ssdt_load when the kernel is locked down"](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=1957a85b0032a81e6482ca4aab883643b8dae06e) applied?
### Is upstream commit [75b0cea7bf307f362057cc778efe89af4c615354 "ACPI: configfs: Disallow loading ACPI tables when locked down"](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=75b0cea7bf307f362057cc778efe89af4c615354) applied?
### Is upstream commit [eadb2f47a3ced5c64b23b90fd2a3463f63726066 "lockdown: also lock down previous kgdb use"](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=eadb2f47a3ced5c64b23b90fd2a3463f63726066) applied?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### If you use vendor_db functionality of providing multiple certificates and/or hashes please briefly describe your certificate setup.
### If there are allow-listed hashes please provide exact binaries for which hashes are created via file sharing service, available in public with anonymous access for verification.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[your text here]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### If you are re-using a previously used (CA) certificate, you will need to add the hashes of the previous GRUB2 binaries exposed to the CVEs to vendor_dbx in shim in order to prevent GRUB2 from being able to chainload those older GRUB2 binaries. If you are changing to a new (CA) certificate, this does not apply.
### Please describe your strategy.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[your text here]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### What OS and toolchain must we use to reproduce this build?  Include where to find it, etc.  We're going to try to reproduce your build as closely as possible to verify that it's really a build of the source tree you tell us it is, so these need to be fairly thorough. At the very least include the specific versions of gcc, binutils, and gnu-efi which were used, and where to find those binaries.
### If the shim binaries can't be reproduced using the provided Dockerfile, please explain why that's the case and what the differences would be.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[your text here]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Which files in this repo are the logs for your build?
This should include logs for creating the buildroots, applying patches, doing the build, creating the archives, etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[your text here]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### What changes were made since your SHIM was last signed?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[your text here]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### What is the SHA256 hash of your final SHIM binary?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[your text here]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### How do you manage and protect the keys used in your SHIM?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[your text here]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Do you use EV certificates as embedded certificates in the SHIM?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[your text here]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Do you add a vendor-specific SBAT entry to the SBAT section in each binary that supports SBAT metadata ( grub2, fwupd, fwupdate, shim + all child shim binaries )?
### Please provide exact SBAT entries for all SBAT binaries you are booting or planning to boot directly through shim.
### Where your code is only slightly modified from an upstream vendor's, please also preserve their SBAT entries to simplify revocation.
