###### Please create your shim binaries starting with the 15.4 shim release tar file:
###### https://github.com/rhboot/shim/releases/download/15.4/shim-15.4.tar.bz2
###### This matches https://github.com/rhboot/shim/releases/tag/15.4 and contains

###### Please confirm this as the origin your shim.

###### Where your code is only slightly modified from an upstream vendor's, please also preserve their SBAT entries to simplify revocation
